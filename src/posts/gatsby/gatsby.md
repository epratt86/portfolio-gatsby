## What the hell is a Gatsby?

Gatsby.js is an open source framework built on top of React to produce blazing fast single page applications. Gatsby works by pulling data from a variety of different sources. The architech decides on what makes the most sense:

- Content Management System (WordPress, Contentful, Drupal, etc.) - a CMS gives the client the ability to log in to the site and easily add new posts or pages without having to know any technical jargon.

- Markdown - with minimal effort a new page can be built with simple text that will be converted into HTML that the browser can understand.

- Data - connect your Gatsby site up to an API or database to display information on the fly.

Gatsby will then take the data that is being feed in and create a single page application that loads quickly. A few GraphQL calls will pull in the information that the builder requests and display it in the appropriate manner.
